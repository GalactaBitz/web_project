	<h1>Portfolio</h1>

	<p>This is stuff I made in the DIG2000 class. I got to use Photoshop and Premiere Pro, and now a webite with HTML</p>

	<h5>The Passenger Movie Poster Recreation</h5>

	<p>This is the first thing I made for this class, and it is a recreation of a movie poster from the movie "The Passenger". I used Photoshop for this and how to non-destructively edit images.</p>

	<h5>Imaging Project of Auroratech City</h5>

	<p>This is an imaging project that I had to collect various images online to combine together into... something. I called this "Auroratech City" as it's supposed to be a sci-fi city with some retro and neon vibes thrown in there. I used Photoshop for this as well.</p>

	<h5>One's Thoughts video (ft. Prof. Dufner)</h5>

	<p>This is a video that Prof. Dafner had us put together to get used to Premiere. I used assets that were provided to edit together a short film of a man talking with himself in his mind.</p>

	<h5>unknown.mp4</h5>

	<p>This is some video I found from some phone in the woods a while ago, I don't know what this is supposed to be, but it was kind of spooky. (wink)</p>
